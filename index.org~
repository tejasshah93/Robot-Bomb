* THE GAME

** About the GAME
   The game has a welcome screen which implies the objective of the game through an =asciiart=,after which a menu is brought in \\ 
   which provides the user with options of Quick Play, Custom Play,Help and Quit..
   In Quick Play mode: The user is given a direct experience of moderate screen size,and a selected level to play for.
   In Custom Play mode: The user can select different options for screen size,grid size of robot,no.of decodes and level.
   In Help: The user is given instructions regarding controls of the game and hints.
   By selecting Quit,the game exits.

** Code..Organisation
   The code has been written in two parts classes and the main loop.\\
   The classes have been used to initiate various screens which appear during the game.\\
   There are 4 modules mainly for display of asciiart,menu,options and levels.
   


** About the CLASSES
*** Class Play: 
     This class has functions:-\\
     main    : calls other functions and initiates the game\\
     my      : checks the basic condition for \\
     menu    : creates the menu as required

     nex     : for additional bullets in the game
     levels  : for 1,2,3 levels
     go      : for welcome screen


** Benifits of CLASSES
   Classes helped me in the re-usability of the functions. One class like Window helped in generation of all the \\
   screens through out the game.
   
** MISC
   User has to basically collect all the decodes in order to diffuse the bomb. There are three levels.
   In level1 : Obstructions are made using walls
   In level2 : 2 Guns are shown whose bullets travel in vertical direction
   In level3 : 3 Guns and obstructions,bullets travel in vertical,diagonal directions with some 'intelligence'
